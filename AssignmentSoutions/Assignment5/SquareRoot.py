# 1. Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative
# integer. And since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only
# the integer part of the result is returned. Also, talk about the time complexity of your
# code.
# Test Cases:
# Input: 4
# Output: 2
# Input: 8
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.8284â€¦., the decimal part is truncated and 2 is
# returned.
# Hint: Try to use a modified binary search approach for an optimized solution
